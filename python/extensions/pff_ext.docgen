              integers ('i'), longs ('l'), floats ('f'), and doubles ('d')

@ccOpen
Opens a PFF file

Usage:
  open( file, mode="r" )

Arguments:
  file:  String containing name of file to be opened.
  mode:  Mode in which file is to be opened. Valid values are:
           "r"  for read-only access (default)
           "w"  for write-only access
           "rw" for read-write access  dataset

Return value: Integer ID index associated with file

Throws: TypeError for improper type or number of arguments,
        pff_ext.PFF_Error on error opening file or invalid "mode" value

@ccShow
Print list of open PFF files to stdout.

Usage:
  filelist( range=(1,-1), width=80 )

Arguments:
  range: Tuple containing first and last file ID index to be listed.
         If second index is <= 0, highest index in use is used. If not
         supplied, all open files are listed.
  width:  Maximum width of listing, in characters

Return value:  0, indicates success, or
               otherwise, some other error occurred

Throws: TypeError for improper type or number of arguments

@ccI2f 
Function to decode a floating point number from three 15-bit unsigned
integers.

If the number to be decoded is greater than the largest value that can
be stored in a 32-bit float (overflow), a power-of-10 integer offset
is also returned if OFFSET is non-zero. In the case of underflow, a
negative power-of-10 offset be returned if KEEP is non-zero. If either
OFFSET or KEEP are non-zero, this integer offset is always returned.

Usage:
  u_i2f( t_ival, keep=0, offset=0 )

Arguments:
  t_ival: Tuple containing integer array data, of the form ('i',
          itemsize, stringbuf). (see packaging notes below)
  keep:   If non-zero, a negative power-of-ten integer offset value
          is returned for an underflowing decoded float. Note the
          non-zero KEEP implies non-zero OFFSET.
  offset: If non-zero, a power-of-ten integer offset will additionally
          be returned. It will be non-zero only if the decoded float
          overflows, or if the decoded float underflows AND KEEP is
          non-zero.

Return value: If successful, and KEEP and OFFSET are both zero, the
              decoded float value is returned as a numpy.float32
              value.  If either KEEP or OFFSET are non-zero, a tuple
              containing the decoded float value and an integer
              power-of-ten offset are returned.  On error, an exception
              is raised.

Throws: TypeError for improper type or number of arguments,
        pff_ext.PFF_Error if encoded integers are Larger than 15-bits,
          or the float value overflows when either OFFSET or KEEP is
          non-zero.

Note on array packing:
  The first element of the tuple is a one-character string describing
  the type of the data. The tuple's second element is the size of a
  single element of the array in bytes (found in the itemsize
  attribute of the numpy.ndarray object containing the array). The
  third element is the actual array data, converted to a string with
  the numpy.ndarray.tostring member method. If the the array is not
  present, the tuple's 2nd and 3rd elements should be set to 1 and '',
  respectively.

            tuple is constructed using the xblk_tuple virtual method
            of the pff.blkgrid class
  t_data:   Tuple containing attribute data (DATA), of the form ('f',
            itemsize, stringbuf). (see packaging notes below)

Return value: None

Note on array packing:
  The first element of the tuple is a one-character string describing
  the type of the data. The tuple's second element is the size of a
  single element of the array in bytes (found in the itemsize
  attribute of the numpy.ndarray object containing the array). The
  third element is the actual array data, converted to a string with
  the numpy.ndarray.tostring member method. If the the array is not
  present, the tuple's 2nd and 3rd elements should be set to 1 and '',
  respectively.

Throws: TypeError for improper type or number of arguments

@ccWrUorN
Utility function to finish writing a uniform or nonuniform block grid
dataset to a PFF file. A call to this function should be preceded by a
single call to bld_multiblkds, and a call to fill_multiblkds for each
block in the dataset. This function is designed to be called by the
pff.blkgrid_dataset.ds_write method.

Usage:
  write_multiblkds(id=0)

Arguments:
  id: If positive, integer index of file to which the dataset is to be
      written. Otherwise, the current active file is used.

Return value: None

Throws: TypeError for improper type or number of arguments,
        pff_ext.PFF_Error if the file is not open, or if an error
            occurs while writing the dataset.

@ccScanList
Utility function that scans a supplied list of strings for the string
"findstring", subject to the supplied matching options. Note that
limited wildcarding is supported. The following characters have
special meaning when encountered in the search string:

   "*" is matched by 0 to n characters
   "?" is matched by exactly 1 character
   "^" as a first character anchors the match to the beginning of the
       comment substring
   "$" as a final character anchors the match to the end of the
       comment substring
   "\" escapes "*" and "?" to be used literally anywhere in the search
       string and escapes "^" (and "$") at the beginning only (and end
       only) of the search string to force "^" (or "$") to be
       interpreted literally
This function is designed to be wrapped by the pff.scanlist method.

Usage:
  scanlist(nlist, list, findstring, exactcase=0, match=1)

Arguments:
  nlist:      Number of strings in string list.
  list:       A string buffer which is densely packed with "nlist"
              NULL- terminated list of strings to be searched
  findstring: String to search for.
  exactcase:  If non-zero, exact case matching is required.
  match:      If non-zero (default), indices of strings that match are
              returned, if zero, indices of strings that do NOT match
              are returned.

Return value:
  A buffer containing a packed integer array (or list) of the indicies
  of the list of strings that meet the matching criteria. The
  pff.buf2nparray (or buf2list) function can be used to convert the
  returned buffer into a numpy.ndarray integer array (or list of
  integers).

Throws: TypeError for improper type or number of arguments

@ccHAK
Utility function to pause until the user hits a key on his keyboard.
Note that this does not seem to play well with matplotlib.

Usage:
  hak(prompt='Hit any key: ')

Arguments:
  prompt: prompt string written to terminal

Return value: Integer value of character hit.

Throws: TypeError for improper type or number of arguments
