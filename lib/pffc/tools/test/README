Overview

  Two sample control files (and the necessary sample data files) are provided
  to test pffdiff.

Testing with the "mitl.pffdiff" control file.

  Run the command:
    pffdiff mitl.pffdiff > stdout 2> stderr

  For this case, stdout should be the same as the supplied file mitl.stdout,
  and stderr should be empty.

Testing with the "error.pffdiff" control file.

  Run the command:
    pffdiff error.pffdiff > stdout 2> stderr

  For this case, stdout and stderr should be the same as the supplied files
  error.stdout and error.stderr, respectively.
