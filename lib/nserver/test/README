Overview

  TNSERVER tests routines in the NSERVER library. All routines are
  exercised.

Using TNSERVER

  Run make with the command line "make". Some changes to the Makefile
  may be required on a new machine or with a newer version of an
  operating system. 

  Now run TNSERVER, redirecting output (and stderr) to a file.  This 
  output file should contain the same information as the supplied 
  output file "stdout.ref".  The error output should be empty.

  Example:

  sahp058% tnserver > stdout 2> stderr
  sahp058% diff -wb stdout stdout.ref
  sahp058% cat stderr
  sahp058%
