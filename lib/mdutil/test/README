Overview

  TMDUTIL tests routines in the MDUTIL library. All routines are
  exercised.

Using TMDUTIL

  Run make with the command line "make". Some changes to the Makefile
  may be required on a new machine or with a newer version of an
  operating system. 

  Now run TMDUTIL using some command line arguments. TMDUTIL will
  echo the date/time and any command line arguments. The spawn 
  test spawns a shell/CLI. During the spawn test create a file to 
  use in the delete file test. To end the spawn test, exit the 
  shell/CLI in the usual manner. The delete file test accepts 
  complete path names. To end the delete file test enter a blank
  line.

  Example:

  $ tmdutil HOME arg2  "" " " arg5
   --04/19/06  10:03:01--
   There were  5 command line arguments:
      0    7 "tmdutil"
      1    4 "HOME"
      2    4 "arg2"
      3    0 ""
      4    1 " "
      5    4 "arg5"
      6   -1
   HOME:            0 /remote/dbseide
   fputen Ret. val.:            0
   arg2:            0 /remote/dbseide
   begin sleep test (5 sec)
   end sleep test
   begin mdotxf test
  Temporary File Name ? tmdutil.F

   *** MDOTXF: ERROR
       File failed to open
       File name: tmdutil.f

   error opening tmdutil.f:  -1
  Temporary File Name ? junk.tmp
  One line written: <CR> to continue 
  mdflsh called: <CR> to continue 
   file junk.tmp closed.
   begin spawn test
  Spawned>> ls > junk
  Spawned>> exit
   end spawn test
   begin delete file test
  File Name ? ./junk
   ND =  1
  File Name ? ./junk.tmp
   ND =  1
  File Name ? ./not_a_file
   ND =  0
  File Name ? 
   begin set width test
   ************************************************** width =   132 ********** 
  <CR> to continue: 

   width =  80
   end set width test
   Page length =  24
   begin stderr test - writing text message to stderr
   This message should go to STDERR
   calling cexit with value 2
  $ echo $?
  2


   >>> the first number for each argument is its position
   >>> the second number for each argument is its length (in characters)
   >>> when testing mdotxf, the open should fail for an existing file;
       the test pauses after a line has been written to the file, and again
       after the buffer is flushed so that the file can be examined to see 
       if mdflsh is properly flushing a file's output buffer.
   >>> ND is the number of files deleted
   >>> the output from the set width test was truncated to 80 columns
   >>> the line "This message should go to STDERR" should go to wherever
       stderr is directed
   >>> the cexit call should provide a return value if the operating 
       system supports return values
