Overview

  TMDUTIL tests routines in the MDUTIL library. All routines are
  exercised.

Using TMDUTIL

  Run make with the command line "make". Some changes to the Makefile
  may be required on a new machine or with a newer version of an
  operating system. 

  Now run TMDUTIL using some command line arguments. TMDUTIL will
  echo the date/time and any command line arguments. The spawn 
  test spawns a shell/CLI. During the spawn test create a file to 
  use in the delete file test. To end the spawn test, exit the 
  shell/CLI in the usual manner. The delete file test accepts 
  complete path names. To end the delete file test enter a blank
  line.

  Example:

  $ tmdutil HOME arg2  "" " " arg5
   --04/19/06  10:03:01--
   There were  5 command line arguments:
      0    7 "tmdutil"
      1    4 "HOME"
      2    4 "arg2"
      3    0 ""
      4    1 " "
      5    4 "arg5"
      6   -1
   HOME:            0 /remote/dbseide
   fputen Ret. val.:            0
   arg2:            0 /remote/dbseide
   begin sleep test (5 sec)
   end sleep test

   >>> when testing mdotxf, the open should fail for an existing file;
       the test pauses after a line has been written to the file, and again
       after the buffer is flushed so that the file can be examined to see 
       if mdflsh is properly flushing a file's output buffer.
   >>> ND is the number of files deleted
   >>> the output from the set width test was truncated to 80 columns
   >>> The required size of the random number seed array should be less than
       or equal to the current size.
   >>> The two sets of five random numbers should match, and there SHOULD
       NOT be an error message from mdrchk.
   >>> The output from the bitwise operations test should exactly match.
   >>> the line "This message should go to STDERR" should go to wherever
       stderr is directed
   >>> the cexit call should provide a return value if the operating 
       system supports return values
