# Macro definitions

#   HU_ENDIAN       - Hardware byte ordering, legal values are:
#                     HU_ENDIAN_IS_LSB_LAST, HU_ENDIAN_IS_LSB_FIRST
#   HU_LRSHIFT      - Indicates where or not Fortran has the lshift and
#                     rshift intrinsic functions, legal values are:
#                     HU_HAVE_LRSHIFT, HU_NEED_LRSHIFT
#   HU_PTR_BYTES    - Length of pointers, in bytes (integer)
#   HU_PTR_TYPE     - Fortran type to be used for pointer values
#   HU_POSIX        - POSIX or POSIX-like file naming.
#   HU_RSEED_TYPE   - Generic type of Fortran random number generator. Legal
#                     values are:
#                     HU_RSEED_RAN, HU_RSEED_RAN_PLUS_EPS, HU_RSEED_F90
#   HU_RSEED_SIZE   - Number of integer words required for Fortran random
#                     number seed (integer)
#   HU_EOF_STAT     - Fortran error status value returned when an attempt is
#                     made to read beyond the last record in a direct-access
#                     file.
#   HU_RECLU_SIZE   - Number of bytes in the unit that Fortran file records
#                     are measured in (integer)
#   HU_MANGLING     - C name mangling to conform to Fortran naming conventions.
#                     See lib/mdqs/mdf77mangle.h for description and legal
#                     values.

# these lines should be system independent using macros defined in the
# system-specific makeopts files.
